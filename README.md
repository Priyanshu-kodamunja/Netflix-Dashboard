📊Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

🔍Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes data trends such as content ratings, genres, release years, countries, and more.
The main objective of this project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, visual storytelling, and interactive reporting.

🧹Data Preparation:
Dataset Source: Netflix Titles Dataset – Kaggle

Steps performed before visualization:
1. Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates and null values.
2. Standardization – Formatted date, duration, and categorical columns.
3. Transformation – Extracted and grouped columns for better analysis (e.g., by genre, release year, rating).
4. Data Import – Loaded cleaned data into Power BI for visualization.

📈 Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard includes multiple pages highlighting key metrics:
1. Overview Page – Summary of total shows, movies, and TV shows.
2. Genre Distribution – Top genres by count of titles.
3. Content Rating – Visualization of audience ratings (TV-MA, PG, etc.).
4. Release Trends – Year-wise analysis of content released.
5. Country Insights – Geographical distribution of content production.
6. Duration Analysis – Comparison of average duration for movies and shows.
